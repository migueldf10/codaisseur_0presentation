			<h1>Hola! It's Miguel Domenech</h1>

			<h2>About me 🧑‍💻</h2>
			<p>Although I studied Architecture I always have been deeply interested in computer programming. My first inmersion was connecting <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino boards and light sensors</a>.</p>
			<p>That interest led me to learn many things by myself and ultimately joining in some startups as web designer, marketing manager and doing some front-end development using basic programming inside platforms such as <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
			<p>After, I kept doing it but as a freelance designer and Growth Hacker.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Motivation 🧑‍🎓</h2>
			<p>My goal in this course is to get the knowledge and confidence I lack in full-stack development.</p>
			<p>Ideally, I will try to combine it with my +5 years of experience as web designer and growth marketer to participate in the full stack of interesting & fun projects.</p>
